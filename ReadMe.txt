This example will show you how to Dock and Undock four forms at a time, or just one specific form at a time. Any changes made to these projects should be sent to me first before they are made public! The project "Advanced Code Editor" is copyrighted by White Blotter, Inc., and was uploaded for educational purposes, not as a head start for your next project!

REMEMBER: When unzip[ing this project, use the folder names, or you WILL encounter errors! Make sure that the forms and binarys are all in the FORMS folder, same goes for the modules.
